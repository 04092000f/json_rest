# json_rest
Created JSON REST API with CRUD operations for Provider (name, email, phone number, language and currency) and ServiceArea (name, price, geojson information)

1. Build a JSON REST API with CRUD operations for Provider (name, email, phone number, language and currency) and ServiceArea (name, price, geojson information)
2. Create a specific endpoint that takes a lat/lng pair as arguments and return a list of all polygons that include the given lat/lng. The name of the polygon, provider's name, and price should be returned for each polygon. This operation should be FAST.
3. Created unit tests to test your API;
